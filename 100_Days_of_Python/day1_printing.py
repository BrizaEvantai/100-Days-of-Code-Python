# This is how you use the print function in Python. You can use both single
# and double quotation marks. For now, you can simply use single when your
# text contains double, and double when your text contains single.


""" You can add comments using the # sign, or longer comments by writing the
text in between 3 double quotation marks at the beginning of the text and
3 double quotation marks at the end of the text. """
